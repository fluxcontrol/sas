0.1
 * all mnemonics for x86, but only using registers (and possibly immediates)

0.2
 * immediate operands for all relevant mnemonics
 * memory referencing for all relevant mnemonics

0.3
 * floating point
 * later mnemonics (pentium, etc.)
 * SIMD (sse, 3dnow!, etc.)

0.4
 * source labels and address calculations
 * basic assembler directives

0.5
 * MIPS chipset mnemonics

0.6
 * ARM chipset mnemonics

0.7
 * macro programming - as a plugin module; it will likely enlarge the core by a
   substantial ammount, so making it an optional component may be
   useful/necessary for embedded systems

0.8
 * Additional chipset mnemonics
